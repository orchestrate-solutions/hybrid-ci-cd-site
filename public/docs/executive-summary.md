# Executive Summary

A cloud-orchestrated CI/CD platform that eliminates the trade-off between operational simplicity and security control. The system provides managed orchestration through a lightweight SaaS control plane while keeping all secrets, credentials, and sensitive workloads inside your own cloud infrastructure—ensuring the platform provider never has access to your data.

This architecture delivers enterprise-grade security, leveraging modern session management and workload identity federation instead of legacy token-based systems. It is designed to reduce infrastructure maintenance overhead by 60-80% while achieving a superior security posture and satisfying stringent regulatory compliance[1][2].
