# This file disables Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages
# Required for Next.js static exports which use the _next/ directory
# Without this file, GitHub Pages' Jekyll processor would try to build the site
# and remove directories starting with underscore, breaking the application

# GitHub Pages detects this file and skips Jekyll processing entirely
# Allowing the pre-built static files to be served as-is
